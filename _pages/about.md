# Contact
##### Feel free to contact me; I'm always looking for new opportunities! The best way to contact me right now is through my email. Linkedin also works but I don't check it as often. Honestly, I don't use Twitter or Bluesky, but I plan to start posting my new projects and blog posts on there to get more reach.
