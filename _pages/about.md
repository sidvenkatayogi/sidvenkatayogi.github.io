title: "About Me"
---
Welcome! I'm a freshman (unsure if im graduating 2028 or 2029 tho) and computer science student at UT Austin. I'm interested in exploring many computer science/programming topics, but some that I'm currently interested in are Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Graphics. I'm especially interested in using these topics in software for real users. I'm still trying to decide between pursuing industry, a PhD, or a startup.

In my free time, I like to study various math topics, [draw](/art), write comics, watch shows/movies (currently watching One Piece), play basketball/ volleyball/ soccer (non-competitively), or go to the gym.

## Contact
Feel free to contact me; I'm always looking for new opportunities! The best way to contact me right now is through my email. Linkedin also works but I don't check it as often. Honestly, I don't use Twitter or Bluesky, but I plan to start posting my new projects and blog posts on there to get more reach.
