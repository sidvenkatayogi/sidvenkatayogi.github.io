<div style="text-align: right; padding-right: 10%;"><h3>who/what is elph/elphcomics?</h3></div>
Elph (pronounced same as "elf") is my artist persona (thats how I'd describe it ig?) It's basically the name I like signing on my art with (see: Elph Mart on [cornerstore chaos](/art/cornerstore-chaos) (wish I had more examples of this on my website but I tend to add it more on sketches and more inked work, which I don't keep on my portfolio)), the name I publish comics under (or at least plan to 😭), and in general my username for online platforms that are more social and fun (think tiktok, video games, discord...). A lot of people ask me where the name comes from and ngl there's not crazy meaning behind it, I just liked the vibes and idea of an elf, but I knew that I would never come up in a google search if I made "elf" my username. The "comics" part I just add because for some reason the user "elph" usually already exists.

### favorite music?
Lowk I listen to anything (except country lol). But that's not a great answer so here's like some of my favorite artists (there's a lot of them lol) (in no particular order): DC the Don, Glaive, PARTYNEXTDOOR, Daniel Caesar, Dominic Fike, BETWEEN FRIENDS, Ken Carson, SoFaygo, Beabadoobee, Weston Estate, Paris Texas, Don Toliver, Prettifun, Gracie Abrams, Jean Dawson, Lil Tecca, 2Hollis, and some underground rap. That's definitely not all the people I like but there's just so much good music out there.
