    <h3>what's my profile picture?</h3>
    <p>Eiji Nizuma from Bakuman, a manga I really like. In the story, he's like a genius who's cracked at making manga. Very eccentric very cool guy.</p>

### favorite music?
Lowkey I listen to anything (except country lol). But that's not a great answer so here's like some of my favorite artists (there's a lot of them lol) (in no particular order): DC the Don, Glaive, PARTYNEXTDOOR, Daniel Caesar, Dominic Fike, BETWEEN FRIENDS, Ken Carson, SoFaygo, Beabadoobee, Weston Estate, Paris Texas, Don Toliver, Prettifun, Gracie Abrams, Jean Dawson, Lil Tecca, 2Hollis, and some underground rap. That's definitely not all the people I like but there's just so much good music out there.
