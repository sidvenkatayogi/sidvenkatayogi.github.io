The website I made like 2 months ago was ok, but I saw some other website and got jealous because mine was kinda trash. So I made a new one, without a template and a bunch of Gemini CLI(almost everything). I think it looks a lot cleaner and isn't as boring as the old one. I think its a lot more interesting for someone new coming here. Tbh I did this to take some time away from making an actual project, but now that it's done I need to get back to things that I'll actually learn from/are usable. I really like the background animation, which I stole from [here](https://codepen.io/bsehovac/pen/LQVzxJ).
