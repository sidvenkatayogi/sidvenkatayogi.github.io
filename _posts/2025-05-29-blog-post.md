I just started my first personal website! I'm still working on different parts of the website but I finished adding my info, socials, and art. I think that's a good start for the first day. S/o to the academic pages template!!! Normally I wouldn't do this, but I just copied the template and vibe coded the rest. I know minimal HTML/CSS, and I don't want to spend toooo much time learning it or making this website. This site is mostly just to showcase the projects in the future. I don't have many impressive coding projects to put in the programming section right now, so I have to get to work this summer.
