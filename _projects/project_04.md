#### Wispr Edit is a voice-to-text application inspired by [Wispr Flow](https://wisprflow.ai/). It brings fast, accurate voice typing to any application on your computer and adds a "Smart Edit" feature that lets you modify text using natural language voice commands.
<br />

#### Ex: remove that, turn this into a bulleted list, summarize the last few sentences
<br />

#### Streamlines writing even more than regular dictation!
<br />

#### **Local Transcription**: Private, local processing with OpenAI's Whisper.
#### **Smart Editing**: Modify text using natural language commands powered by Google Gemini.
#### **Context Aware**: Intelligently distinguishes between dictation and editing.
<br />
