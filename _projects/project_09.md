#### My team's [TAMUHack26](https://th26.tamuhack.org/) project! Made in 24 hours.

<br />

#### Introducing FlightSense: a decentralized prediction market for flight delays.
#### Instead of relying on static schedules and reactive metrics, FlightSense incentivizes hedge funds, traders, and data scientists to forecast flight disruptions. By creating a liquid market on the Solana blockchain, we generate real-time probability data that provides a strong signal around flight outcomes, helping airlines better predict their flight delays and cancellations, as well as providing data for an additional variable in a more complex internal forecasting algorithm.
