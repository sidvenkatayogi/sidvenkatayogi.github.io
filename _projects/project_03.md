#### Some NLP Projects I've done while watching the CS371N: Natural Language Processing course at UT. Haven't actually attended the class at UT yet, but there's a [youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLofp2YXfp7TZZ5c7HEChs0_wfEfewLDs7) and [course page](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~gdurrett/courses/fa2024/cs371n.shtml) that is really useful. There's actually 2 courses that go along with the youtube playlist, the other one is [CS388/AI388/DSC395T: Natural Language Processing (online MS)](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~gdurrett/courses/online-course/materials.html) which covers the youtube playlist fully. I'm still going through the course, and plan to make more progress in the coming breaks. [Github repository!](https://github.com/sidvenkatayogi/CS371N_NLP_F2024)
