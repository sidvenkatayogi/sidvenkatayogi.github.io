#### A research project I worked on Fall 2025. Submitted to [ACL 2026](https://2026.aclweb.org/), in review rn! About how current LLMs consistently stay faithful to provided context/scientific evidence, even when such evidence contains false and possibly harmful information (overriding safety), particularly in medicine (high stakes domain).
